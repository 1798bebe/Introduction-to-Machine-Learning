[Application of Machine Learning Techniques using Python]
This final project aims to understand the key concepts learned in the EEE3142 Introduction to Machine Learning course and implement them using Python. 
Throughout the course, we have delved into foundational techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). 
This project serves as a culmination of these topics, providing hands-on experience in applying them to real-world data.

The tasks set forth involve reconstructing data projections using PCA and analyzing the associated reconstruction errors. 
Further, we will model data distributions employing GMMs and implement SVMs for classification purposes. 
Through these exercises, we endeavor to solidify our grasp of machine learning methodologies and enhance our proficiency in leveraging Python for intricate data-driven challenges.
